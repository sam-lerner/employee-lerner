## Description

This project utilizes cutting edge technology to allow the user to keep track of their team of employees. The user can both add new information and review current information in the database. 

This project is a `Node.js` command line application that utilizes `inquirer` prompts to write data to `MySQL`. 

## Installation

First, the user should use `git clone` to copy this repository. Once this is complete, running `npm init -y` followed by `npm i` will install all needed dependencies. 

In order to interact with `MySQL`, it is necessary to run the `schema.sql` to create your basic database. Different computers interact differently with `MySQL`, so please ensure you follow the method that works best for you. Once you are able to connect, log in with your credentials: `mysql -u <your username> -p <your password>` The schema can then be copied and pasted into your terminal window. 

Note that the repo also contains some seed data for testing purposes. If desired, it can also be copied into your `MySQL` database.

## Usage

To run the actual program, key in `node index`. You will then be taken through a series of prompts.
